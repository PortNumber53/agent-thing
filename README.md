# Agent Thing

An AI-powered developer agent with a Go backend, a React/Vite frontend, and a Docker-based development sandbox. The agent exposes tools (shell, file read/write, Docker lifecycle, SSH keygen, etc.) and chats over WebSocket.

## Architecture

- Backend (Go):
  - Web server on `:8080` with WebSocket endpoint at `/ws`.
  - Serves the frontend during development.
  - Manages a long-lived Docker container to execute tools in a controlled environment.
  - Integrates with Google Gemini via `internal/llm` with per-minute rate limiting.
- Frontend (React + Vite):
  - Dev server proxies `/ws` to the Go server.
  - Chat UI to converse with the agent and execute tools.
- Docker:
  - `Dockerfile` builds the development environment image used by the agent.
  - On Apple Silicon, the base image is pinned to amd64 for compatibility.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Docker Desktop

## Configuration

Create a config file at:

`$HOME/.config/agent-thing/config.ini`

Example contents:

```ini
[default]
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=agent
DB_USER=agent
DB_PASSWORD=agent
DB_SSLMODE=disable

# Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
GEMINI_RPM=10

# Host directory mounted into the dev container as /home/developer
CHROOT_DIR=/tmp/agent-thing-chroot
```

Notes:

- The application reads this exact path at startup.
- On first run, the agent will `sudo chown -Rv 1000:1000` the `CHROOT_DIR` to match the container user.

## Run the backend

```bash
go run agent.go
```

This will:

- Build the Docker image (first run may take a while)
- Create/start the `dev-environment` container
- Start the WebSocket server on `http://localhost:8080/ws`

## Run the frontend (dev)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`). The Vite dev server proxies `/ws` to `http://localhost:8080/ws`.

## Database migrations

Use the built-in migration subcommands from the Go app:

```bash
# Create timestamped up/down SQL files under db/migrations
go run ./agent.go migrate create <name>

# Apply or rollback migrations using the DSN from config.ini
go run ./agent.go migrate up
go run ./agent.go migrate down
go run ./agent.go migrate status
```

## Tools available (agent side)

Implemented in `internal/tools/` and available through chat or toolbar buttons:

- conversation: plain text responses
- shell: run shell commands in the persistent container session
- file_read, file_write, file_list: file utilities in `/home/developer`
- ssh_key_gen: generate an SSH keypair inside the container
- docker_start, docker_stop, docker_rebuild, docker_status: container lifecycle
- autonomous_execution: multi-step tool orchestration

## Frontend UI

- Top toolbar buttons drive common tools (Docker lifecycle, SSH key generation, file copy/download).
- The message list shows agent and user messages.
- The status bar displays connection and action status.

## Notes on Apple Silicon

- The base image is forced to amd64 for compatibility. Docker will use emulation; expect larger images and slower builds.

## Development tips

- The WebSocket endpoint is `/ws`; the frontend connects to `ws://<host>/ws`.
- The backend serves static files from `./frontend/` for convenience, but during development use Vite (`npm run dev`).

## Deployment

- Refer to `deploy/README.md` for details on the Jenkins pipeline, systemd unit, and nginx routing used in production.
